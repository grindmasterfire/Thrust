cipherhub.shield
----------------

The SHIELD subsystem handles safe‑boot recovery for agents and
components within the CipherWorks platform.  In the event of a crash
or corrupted state, SHIELD can restore persisted memory maps and
thoughts from MNEMOS and ensure that THRUST is reset to a sane
configuration.

This stub implementation simply prints an informational message when
``recover`` is invoked.
