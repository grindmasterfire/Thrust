cipherhub.pulse
----------------

The PULSE subsystem provides realâ€‘time telemetry for memory usage
within the CipherWorks platform.  It will eventually render a
heatmap of memory allocation and usage across agents and processes.

This stub implementation returns a dummy data structure when
``generate_heatmap`` is called.  Consumers can use this to build
mock visualisations during development.
