----------------

The IGNITE subsystem automatically tunes inference settings for
supported AI runtimes.  It can adjust CPU affinity, priority and
cache parameters on the fly based on observed workload and system
load.  IGNITE integrates both MNEMOS (for memory awareness) and
THRUST (for performance controls).

This stub implementation provides a placeholder ``auto_tune`` method
that logs an informational message.
