"""
cipherhub.launcher
------------------

The main entry point for the CipherWorks Hub.  The launcher ties
together THRUST, MNEMOS and other subsystems (PULSE, SHIELD, IGNITE,
MUTE) into a unified interface.  In a future release this will
provide a graphical dashboard showing live performance metrics and
controls for memory management and inference tuning.

For now, ``CipherHubLauncher`` exposes a few simple methods that
delegate to stub modules.  These are intended to document the
expected interactions and will be expanded upon as the project
progresses.
