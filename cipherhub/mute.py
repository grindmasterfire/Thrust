cipherhub.mute
--------------

The MUTE subsystem provides memory recovery and emergency flush
capabilities for the CipherWorks platform.  It complements THRUST's
``flush_memory`` by integrating with MNEMOS to ensure that persistent
state is not lost during aggressive cleaning.

In this stub implementation, ``prune`` simply prints a message.
Future versions will coordinate with THRUST and MNEMOS to free memory
while preserving critical agent state.
